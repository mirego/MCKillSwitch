# MCKillSwitch

MCKillSwitch is the official kill switch to use with Mirego’s backend implementation (see API Specs).

## Using

Keep a strong instance of `MCKillSwitchAlert` in your class. The alert will be the delegate of the kill switch.

```objc
@property (nonatomic) MCKillSwitchAlert *killSwitchAlert;
```

Then execute the kill switch when needed.

```objc
NSURL *baseURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://api.project.com"];

MCKillSwitch *killSwitch = [[MCKillSwitch alloc] initWithBaseURL:baseURL];
killSwitch.delegate = _killSwitchAlert;
[killSwitch execute];

```

## Button Types

### URL
You can specify an URL like this:

Open URL in Safari:
```
"type": "url",
"label": "Upgrade",
"url": "http://google.com"
```

Open AppStore directly in the current app:
```
"type": "url",
"label": "Upgrade",
"url": "store:507874739"
```

## Adding to your project

If you're using [`CocoaPods`](http://cocoapods.org/), there's nothing simpler.
Add the following to your [`Podfile`](http://docs.cocoapods.org/podfile.html)
and run `pod install`

```ruby
pod 'MCKillSwitch', :git => 'https://github.com/mirego/MCKillswitch.git'
```
